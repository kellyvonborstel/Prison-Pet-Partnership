          <h2 class="clearBoth">About Our Kennels</h2>
          <p>We have 28 indoor dog kennel runs, 20 that measure 15' x 4' and 8 that are 15' x 3'. Dogs are exercised several times a day and enjoy either a nice walk or a run in our field for no additional charge. Bedding and toys are provided due to the fact that personal items cannot be returned to you after your animals stay. Currently we have 7 cat kennels measuring 5' x 2.5' x 2'. These kennels are separated into two sections to keep food and litter boxes separated. During the day cats are given the opportunity to roam around the cat room. There are several cat posts to play on and places to lounge. Due to the level of care needed with geriatric pets, we do not accept new clients with dogs over 10 years old for boarding. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
          <p><strong>Please do not bring your dogs personal bedding or feeding items as we cannot get them back to you! This also includes any extra food — please only bring enough for the stay!</strong></p>
