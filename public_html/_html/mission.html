          <h1>Mission</h1>
          <img src="../_images/woman-with-service-dog.jpg" alt="Service Dog">
          <p class="mission">Prison Pet Partnership enriches the lives of inmates, homeless animals and the community through the human-animal bond.</p>
          <p>Our mission allows us to grow in many directions, using our foundation of rescuing and training homeless animals and providing job skills training to women inmates. We continue to rescue, train and place service, therapy and companion animals, and also provide animal-assisted therapeutic visits to local convalescent centers, and help students improve reading skills by having dogs listen while children read aloud. We have boarding and grooming facilities to teach women inmates job skills, and we also help inmates write resumes, and practice interviewing skills. PPP scouts for job opportunities in the community in which an inmate will be released, and provide support through job placement as she transitions back into the community.</p>
          <p>Prison Pet Partnership began in 1982 as part of Tacoma Community College’s inmate education program, and became an independent Washington nonprofit corporation on May 30, 1990. We are registered with the IRS as a 501c3.</p>
          <p>Prison Pet Partnership’s facility is located on the grounds of the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor, Washington. The program is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. The day-to-day operations are the responsibility of an Executive Director, a Training Coordinator, and a Vocational Education Coordinator with support provided by a Program Assistant. Inmate employees support the boarding kennel, the grooming service, and service dog training.</p>
