        <h2>Ambassador Program</h2>
        <p>Sister Pauline Quinn founded the first ever prison dog program, Prison Pet Partnership in 1981 on the belief that self-worth is best measured not by what you do for yourself but what you do for others and by thinking of and working for others, you begin to heal yourself.  In light of her recent passing and to honor Sister Pauline, PPP is more determined than ever to carry on her vision, hard work and incredible impact.</p>
        <h4>You can help make that happen!</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The loss of income usually generated by our boarding and grooming services and the cancellation of our annual fundraiser, due to COVID-19 precautions, has caused Prison Pet Partnership and many nonprofits to worry for the future of our programming. Our staff is committed to continuing the mission Sister Pauline started and passing it on for incarcerated individuals, community members, and dogs in need. And we need your help to do it!</p>
