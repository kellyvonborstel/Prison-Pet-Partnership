        <h4>About Our Kennels</h4>
        <p>We have 28 indoor dog kennel runs, 20 that measure 15' x 4' and 8 that are 15' x 3'. Dogs are exercised several times a day and enjoy either a nice walk or a run in our field for no additional charge. Bedding and toys are provided due to the fact that personal items cannot be returned to you after your animals stay. Currently we have 7 cat kennels measuring 5' x 2.5' x 2'. These kennels are separated into two sections to keep food and litter boxes separated. During the day cats are given the opportunity to roam around the cat room. There are several cat posts to play on and places to lounge. Due to the level of care needed with geriatric pets, we do not accept new clients with dogs over 10 years old for boarding. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Please do not bring your dogs personal bedding or feeding items as we cannot get them back to you! This also includes any extra food — please only bring enough for the stay!</strong></p>

        <hr id="bt">
        <h4>Board and Train</h4>
        <p>Prison Pet Partnership can provide obedience dog training as an optional add-on service while your dog is boarding with us.  Dogs that are participating in our Board &amp; Train program will be scheduled to spend at least an hour a day working one-on-one with one of our highly skilled trainers.</p> 
        <p>The supplemental Board &amp; Train application and Expectations Contract can be found in the <a href="../pdf/board-groom-train-app.pdf" target="_blank">Boarding &amp; Grooming Application</a>. Please return these documents to our office, if you would like to add this service to your dog’s stay. </p> 
        <h5>What Will We Teach Your Pet?</h5>
        <p>Our program will help your dog learn basic obedience skills, such as walking nicely on a leash, Sit, Down, Stay, Leave It and coming when called.</p>  
        <p>Unfortunately, at this time, we are not able to work with dogs who need help with challenging behaviors, such as fear, anxiety or reactivity towards people or other animals.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about whether your dog may benefit from our Board &amp; Train service, please call our office at (253) 858-4240 and ask to speak with our Training Clerk.</p>
        <h5>What are the fees?</h5>
        <p>The Board &amp; Train program is an optional additional service with a fee of $40 per day. This is in addition to your boarding costs. We request a minimum of a 14-day stay for your first boarding appointment. Not all 14 days have to be dedicated to training, however for every 7 days of training you will only be charged for 6.</p>
